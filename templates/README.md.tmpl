Why SimpleDocumenter?
=====================

<b>Absolute Portability</b>

SimpleDocumenter is a single file with no dependencies, and is only {sloc} lines long.<br/>
As such, portability is absolute, since a local copy of SimpleDocumenter can be gotten via HTTP GET. Or, if your environment is firewalled and HTTP isn't allowed, you can copy & paste the source code into a local file.

<b>Callback Filtering</b>
```php
{example-2}
```

<b>Trade-offs</b>

SimpleDocumenter only works on classes. It can't analyze functions in the global namespace.
